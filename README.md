## Key Findings
- Average sleep is **below the recommended 7–9 hours**, suggesting opportunities for sleep-related product features.
- Calories burned fluctuate daily but remain relatively consistent across users.
- Weight data shows minor fluctuations and may have limitations due to incomplete tracking.
- Weak correlations exist between sleep and calories, and between weight and calories.



## Recommendations
- Implement sleep reminders and tips for better sleep habits.
- Encourage increased daily activity through personalized goals and notifications.
- Improve weight tracking features for more consistent insights.
